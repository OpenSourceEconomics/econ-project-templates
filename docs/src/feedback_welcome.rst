Feedback welcome
================

I have had a lot of feedback from former students who found this helpful. But in-class exposure to material is always different than reading up on it and I am sure that there are difficult-to-understand parts. I would love to hear about them! Please `drop me a line <mailto:hmgaudecker@gmail.com>`_ or, if you have concrete suggestions, `file an issue <https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-templates/issues>`_ on GitHub.
