Templates for Reproducible Research Projects in Economics
*********************************************************

An empirical or computational research project only becomes a useful building block for science when **all** steps can be easily repeated and modified by others. This means that we should automate as much as possible, compared to pointing and clicking with a mouse or, more generally, keeping track yourself of what needs to be done.

This is a collection of templates where much of this automation is pre-configured via describing the research workflow as a directed acyclic graph (`DAG <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_) using `pytask <https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io>`_. You just need to:

* Install the template for the main language in your project (Python, R, Stata, Matlab, ...)
* Move your programs to the right places and change the placeholder scripts
* Run pytask, which will build your entire project the first time you run it. Later, it will automatically figure out which parts of the project need to be rebuilt.
