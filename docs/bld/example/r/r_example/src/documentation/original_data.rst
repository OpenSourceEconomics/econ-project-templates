Documentation of the different datasets in *original_data*.

In our example we have only one data set *ajrcomment.dta*, which contains data on 64 countries regarding the mortality rates, expropriation risk and GDP as well as several controls (latitude, continent, indicators for soldiers/slaves etc.).

In the original data section you would store the raw data, which you should not manipulate to ensure reproducibility.

If you want to include multiple data sets, you can also create subfolders for the sake of a clear structure.
