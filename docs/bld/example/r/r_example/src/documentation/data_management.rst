Data management

Documentation of the code in *src/data_management*.

Here you would include those steps which are only concerned with cleaning raw data, merging different data sets etc. There is not much to be done in the case of the Albouy (2012) code, as the data set is mostly in the form necessary for the IV estimation. We just add a few observation to new variables that were supplied later by AJR.
