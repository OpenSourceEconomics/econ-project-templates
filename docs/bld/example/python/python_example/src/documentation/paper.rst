    * :file:`research_paper.tex` contains the actual paper.
    * :file:`research_pres_30min.tex` contains a typical conference presentation.
    * :file:`research_pres_90min.tex` contains a full-length seminar presentation (add by yourself).
    * :file:`formulas` contains short files with the LaTeX formulas -- put these into a library for re-use in paper and presentations.
