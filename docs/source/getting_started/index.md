# Getting Started

How to get started depends on what your system looks like. Depending on that, you may
want to jump to any of the sections in this part of the documentation:

- In {ref}`preparing_your_system`, we describe what needs to be installed on your
  computer so that you can use the templates.
- Should you have done that already for a different project, you can directly go to
  {ref}`cookiecutter_dialogue`, which describes the options you have when moving from
  the template to your specific research project.
- In case a project has been set up by you or a collaborator and you want to use it on a
  different machine as well, you will find the explanations on how to do so in
  {ref}`second_machine`.

Once you are set up in this fashion, you may want to read up on the background of the
{ref}`background`. In case you know those already, have a look in
{ref}`guides_explanations` for guides on starting new projects or porting existing ones.
