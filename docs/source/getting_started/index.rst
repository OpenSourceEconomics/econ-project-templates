Getting Started
===============

Here, we first describe in :ref:`preparing_your_system` how you need to set up your
computer so that everything plays well together. In :ref:`dialogue`, you will find
detailed explanations on what you may want to choose when configuring the templates for
your needs. Once you are done with that, you may want to check the
:ref:`starting_a_new_project` section. If you alread have the template running but don't
know how to use a second computer, or work together with a collaborator, you may want
to jump directly to the section on :ref:`second_machine`. We also provide more detailed
explainations of :ref:`environments` and :ref:`pre_commit_hooks`. You can click through
the pages or jump straight to the corresponding sections:


So, ...

* If you want to first get an idea of whether this is the right thing for you, start by
  reading through the :ref:`introduction` or the :ref:`example_project` section.
* If you are hooked already and want to try it out, continue right here with
  :ref:`preparing_your_system`.
* If you have done this before, you can jump directly to :ref:`dialogue`.
