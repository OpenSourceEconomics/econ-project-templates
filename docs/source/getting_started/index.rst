Getting Started
===============

Here, we first describe in :ref:`preparing_your_system` how you need to set up your
computer so that everything plays well together. In :ref:`cookiecutter_dialogue`, you
will find detailed explanations on what to do to configure the templates for your needs.

If you already have the template running but don't know how to use a second computer, or
work together with a collaborator, you may want to jump directly to the section on
:ref:`second_machine`.

Once you are done with the steps in this section, check out the Documentation of the
:ref:`example_project` to understand the details of the setup. In case you know those
already, have a look in :ref:`guides_explanations` for guides on starting / porting
projects and explanations of some of the auxiliary tools.
