Getting Started
===============

Here, we first describe in :ref:`preparing_your_system` how you need to set up your
computer so that everything plays well together. In :ref:`cookiecutter_dialogue`, you
will find detailed explanations on what to do to configure the templates for your needs.

Once you are done with that, you may want to check the section on :ref:`starting a
project from scratch <starting_from_scratch>` or on :ref:`porting an existing project
<porting_existing_project>`.

If you already have the template running but don't know how to use a second
computer, or work together with a collaborator, you may want to jump directly to the
section on :ref:`second_machine`.

Finally, we provide some more detailed explainations of :ref:`environments` and
:ref:`pre_commit_hooks`. You can click through the pages or jump straight to the
corresponding sections.


So, ...

* If you want to first get an idea of whether this is the right thing for you, start by
  reading through the :ref:`introduction` or the :ref:`example_project` section.
* If you are hooked already and want to try it out, continue right here with
  :ref:`preparing_your_system`.
* If you have done this before, you can jump directly to :ref:`cookiecutter_dialogue`.
