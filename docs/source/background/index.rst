Background
##########

This section contains explanations on why the project templates look the way they do.
This includes a short explanation of the content of the pre-installed example, the basic
design rationale, discussion of the workflow, the directory structure we chose, and a
little background on directed acyclic graphs and pytask. There is not much reference to
code or a particular programming language here, this is relegated to the next section.
