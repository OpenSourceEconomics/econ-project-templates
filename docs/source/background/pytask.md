[pytask](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is our tool of choice to automate
the dependency tracking via a DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure. It has been
written by Uni Bonn alumnus [Tobias Raabe](https://github.com/tobiasraabe) out of
frustration with other tools.

pytask is inspired by pytest and leverages the same plugin system. If you are familiar
with pytest, getting started with pytask should be a very smooth process.

pytask will look for Python scripts named `task_[specifier].py` in all subdirectories of
your project. Within those scripts, it will execute functions that start with `task_`.

Have a look at its excellent
[documentation](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). At present, there are
additional plugins to run [R scripts](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r),
[Julia scripts](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-julia),
[Stata do-files](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata), and to compile
[documents via LaTeX](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-latex).

We will have more to say about the directory structure in the {ref}`directory_structure`
section. For now, we note that a step towards achieving the goal of clearly separating
inputs and outputs is that we specify a separate build directory. All output files go
there (including intermediate output), it is never kept under version control, and it
can be safely removed -- everything in it will be reconstructed automatically the next
time you run `pytask`.

### Pytask Overview

From a high-level perspective, pytask works in the following way:

1. pytask reads your instructions and sets the build order.

   - Think of a dependency graph here.
   - pytask stops when it detects a circular dependency or ambiguous ways to build a
     target (e.g., you specify the same target twice).
   - Both are major advantages over a *workflow script*, let alone doing the dependency
     tracking in your mind.

1. pytask decides which tasks need to be executed and performs the required actions.

   - Minimal rebuilds are a huge speed gain compared to a *workflow script*.
   - These gains are large enough to make projects break or succeed.

We have just touched upon the tip of the iceberg here; pytask has many more goodies to
offer. Its [documentation](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an excellent
source.
