The example project that will be installed with the templates is a simple data project.
We wish to estimate the probability of smoking given certain characteristics.

For this we need to load the data, clean the data, estimate a model, and predict using
that model.

After estimating a logistic model we use two categorical variables from the data set:
marital status and qualification, to predict the development of the smoking
probability over the lifetime.

Formalizing these tasks, to build the project we need to perform the following steps:

1.  Download the data
2.  Clean the data
3.  Estimate a logistic model
4.  Predict over the lifetime (for each of the categorical variables)
5.  Visualize the results (for each of the categorical variables)
6.  Use the results in a latex paper

Using the naming of the templates we categorize these tasks into

* Data Management: tasks 1 & 2
* Analysis: tasks 3 & 4
* Final: task 5
* Paper: task 6
