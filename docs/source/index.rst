Templates for Reproducible Research: Documentation

Introduction
============

An empirical or computational research project only becomes a useful building block for
science and policy when all steps can be easily repeated and modified by others.

Hence, some actions should be absent to the greatest extent possible. This includes
copying & pasting, pointing and clicking with a mouse, or other forms of interactive
input, which are not stored as part of the project.

The idea behind these templates is that the researcher specifies a pipeline of tasks,
which are executed as required. The only input required for (re-)producing results will
be the action setting this pipeline to run.

This code base aims to provide two stepping stones to assist you in achieving this goal:

1. A sensible directory structure. This will save you a bunch of thinking about this
   structure and the process of adjusting it, which needs to be done sooner or later
   when starting a new project. Put differently, instead of starting from scratch, you
   modify an example for your needs.
2. Facilitate the reproducibility of your research findings from the beginning to
   the end by letting the computer handle the project's workflow.

The first should lure you in quickly. The second should convince you to stick to the
tools in the long run â€“ unless you have fought with large research projects before, you might
think now that all of this is overkill and far more difficult than necessary. It is not.
*[although I am always* `happy to hear <https://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/>`_
*about easier alternatives]*

The templates support a variety of programming languages already. They can be easily
extended to cover others. Everything is tied together by `pytask
<https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io>`_, which is written in `Python
<http://www.python.org/>`_. You do not need to know a lot of Python to use these tools,
though.


How to proceed
==============

If you are a complete novice, you should read carefully through the entire documents. We
suggest starting with the section :ref:`getting_started`. Once you've finished that we
recommend reading the :ref:`example_project` section.
