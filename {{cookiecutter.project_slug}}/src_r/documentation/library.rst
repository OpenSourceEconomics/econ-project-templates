.. _library:

************
Code library
************


The directory *src/library* provides code that may be used by different steps of the analysis. Little code snippets for input / output or stuff that is not directly related to the model would go here.

The distinction to the *model_code* directory is a bit arbitrary, but I have found it useful in the past.
