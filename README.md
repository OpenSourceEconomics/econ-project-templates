This project provides a template for economists aimed at facilitating the production of
reproducible research using the most commonly used programming languages in the field,
such as Python, R, Julia, and Stata.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the underlying architecture supports all listed programming languages, the
> current template implementation is limited to Python and R.
