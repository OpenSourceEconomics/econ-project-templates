This project provides a template for economists aimed at facilitating the production of
reproducible research using Python. We provide a directory structure, a worked example,
and many helpful modern tools. At its core, the computational pipeline uses
[pytask](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to ensure
reproducibility. While the example focuses on Python, running
[R](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r),
[Julia](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-julia), or
[Stata](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata) is very easy, too. In fact, until
[version 0.9](https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/), the template
included its worked example in R, too. We dropped it purely for lack of resources to
maintain it.

## Getting Started

You can find all necessary resources to get started on our
[documentation](https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Contributing

We welcome suggestions on anything from improving the documentation to reporting bugs
and requesting new features. Please open an
[issue](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates/issues) in these
cases.

If you want to work on a specific feature, we are more than happy to get you started!
Please [get in touch briefly](https://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker), this is a small
team so there is no need for a detailed formal process.
