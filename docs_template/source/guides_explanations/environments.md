Progammes change. Few things are as frustrating as coming back to a project after a long
time and spending the first {hours, days} updating your code to work with a new version
of your favourite data analysis library. The same holds for debugging errors that occur
only because your coauthor uses a slightly different setup.

The solution is to have isolated environments on a per-project basis.
[Conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
allow you to do precisely this. This page describes them a little bit and explains their
use.

The following commands can either be executed in a terminal or the Powershell (Windows).

### Using the environment

In the installation process of the template a new environment was created if it was not
explicitly declined. It took its specification from the environment.yml file in your
projects root folder.

To activate it, execute:

```console
$ conda activate <env_name>
```

Repeat this step every time you want to run your project from a new terminal window.

### Setting up a new environment

If you want to create a clean environment we recommended specifying it through an
environment.yml file. Below we show the contents of an example environment.yml file. A
detailed explanation is given in the
[Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually).

```yaml
name: <env_name>

channels:
  - conda-forge
  - nodefaults

dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - pip
```

If the environment.yml file exists you can create the environment using

```console
$ conda create -f path/to/environment.yml
```

### Updating packages

Make sure you activated the environment by `conda activate <env_name>`. Then run

```console
$ conda update [package]
```

to update a specific `[package]`, or run

```console
$ conda update --all
```

to update all packages.

### Installing additional packages

To list installed packages, activate the environment and type

```console
$ conda list
```

If you want to add a package to your environment, add it to the environment.yml file.
Once you have edited the environment.yml file, run

```console
$ conda env update -f environment.yml
```

**Choosing between conda and pip**

Generally it is recommended to use *conda* whenever possible. It is a necessity for many
scientific packages. These often are not pure-Python code and pip is built mainly for
that. For pure-Python packages, sometimes nobody bothered to set up a conda package and
we use *pip*.

If you add a package under `dependencies:` in the environment.yml file, conda will try
to install its own package. If you add a package under `pip:`, conda will try to install
the package via pip.

### Information about your conda environments

For listing your installed conda environments, type

```console
$ conda info --envs
```

The currently activated one will be marked.
