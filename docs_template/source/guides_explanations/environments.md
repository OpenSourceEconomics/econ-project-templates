Progammes change. Few things are as frustrating as coming back to a project after a long
time and spending the first {hours, days} updating your code to work with a new version
of your favourite data analysis library. The same holds for debugging errors that occur
only because your coauthor uses a slightly different setup.

The solution is to have isolated environments on a per-project basis.
[Pixi environments](https://pixi.sh/latest/tutorials/python/) allow you to do precisely
this. This page describes them a little bit and explains their use.

The following commands can either be executed in a terminal or the Powershell (Windows).

### Using the environment

- The templates ship with a pre-configured environment.

- You can inspect the contents in the [tool.pixi.xxx] sections.

- When you type `pixi run ...` or `pixi install`, the packages are downloaded to the
  `.pixi` folder in the project root.

### Updating packages

Precise versions of packages are pinned down in the file `pixi.lock`, ensuring
reproducibility. If you want to update a package, make sure that you are in the project
root and run

```console
$ pixi update
```

to update all packages, or run

```console
$ pixi update [package]
```

to update a specific `[package]`.

### Installing additional packages

To list installed packages, type

```console
$ pixi list
```

If you want to add a package to your environment, you can add the package to the
`[tool.pixi.dependencies]` section in the pyproject.toml file. Alternatively, you can
run

```console
$ pixi add [package]
```

You will notice that the pixi section in the pyproject.toml file is then also updated
with the added package.

**Choosing between conda-forge and PyPI**

If you add a package under `[tool.pixi.dependencies]` in the pyproject.toml file, pixi
will try to install the package via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/). If you add
a package under `[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]`, pixi will try to install the package
from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

Generally it is recommended to use *conda-forge* whenever possible. It is a necessity
for many scientific packages. These often are not pure-Python code and pip is built
mainly for that. For pure-Python packages, sometimes nobody bothered to set up a
conda-forge package and we use *pip*.
