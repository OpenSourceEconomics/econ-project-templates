# Programming Languages

The templates are pre-configured to use Python, but support a variety of programming
languages via pytask.

To run code written in other languages (R, Julia, Stata), you can use the respective
pytask plugins. All of the plugins can be installed via `pixi`. You can find how-to
guides in the respective README files of the plugins:

- [pytask-r](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-r)
- [pytask-julia](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-julia)
- [pytask-stata](https://github.com/pytask-dev/pytask-stata)

In fact, until [version 0.9](https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.0/),
the template included its worked example in R, too. We dropped it purely for lack of
resources to maintain it.
