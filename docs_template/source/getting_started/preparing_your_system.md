### Programme installation

Make sure you have the following programs installed and that these can be found on your
path. This template requires

- Python, which you must install using the following instructions

  - [Installing Python on Mac](https://effective-programming-practices.vercel.app/python_installation_execution/installation_mac/instructions.html)
  - [Installing Python on Windows](https://effective-programming-practices.vercel.app/python_installation_execution/installation_windows/instructions.html)
  - [Installing Python on WSL (for the adventurous)](https://effective-programming-practices.vercel.app/python_installation_execution/installation_wsl/instructions.html)
  - [Installing Python on Linux](https://effective-programming-practices.vercel.app/python_installation_execution/installation_linux/instructions.html)

- A modern LaTeX distribution (e.g. [TeXLive](https://tug.org/texlive/),
  [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/), or [MikTex](https://miktex.org/))

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), Windows users please also consult
  {ref}`git_windows`

- The text editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), unless you know what you
  are doing.

### Validating the installation paths

If you are on Windows, please open the Windows Powershell. On Mac or Linux, open a
terminal. As everything will be started from the Powershell/Terminal, you need to make
sure that all programmes you need in your project (for sure Python obtained via
Miniforge, Git, and LaTeX; potentially VS Code, R, Julia, Stata) can be found on your
*PATH*. That is, these need to be accessible from your shell. This often requires a bit
of manual work, in particular on Windows.

- To see which programmes can be found on your path, type (leave out the leading dollar
  sign, this is just standard notation for a command line prompt):

  Windows

  ```powershell
  $ echo $env:path
  ```

  Mac/Linux

  ```console
  $ echo $PATH
  ```

  This gives you a list of directories that are available on your *PATH*.

- Check that this list contains the path to the programs you want to use in your
  project, in particular, Miniforge (this contains the required Python distribution), a
  LaTeX distribution, the text editor VS Code, Git, and any other program that you need
  for your project (R, Julia, Stata). Otherwise, add them by looking up their paths on
  your computer and follow the steps described here {ref}`path_windows` or
  {ref}`path_mac`.

- If you added any directory to *PATH*, you need to close and reopen your shell, so that
  this change is implemented.

- To be on the safe side regarding your paths, you can check directly whether you can
  launch the programmes. For Python, type:

  ```console
  $ python
  >>> exit()
  ```

  This starts python in your shell and exits from it again. The top line should indicate
  that you are using a Python distribution provided by conda-forge. Here is an example
  output obtained on Linux:

  ```text
  Python 3.12.4 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Jun 17 2024, 10:23:07) [GCC 12.3.0] on linux
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  ```

  To start and exit pdflatex.

  ```console
  $ pdflatex
  $ X
  ```

  An editor window should open after typing:

  ```console
  $ code
  ```

  If required, do the same for R, Julia, or Stata.

### Navigating to the parent folder and validating Git

In the Powershell/Terminal, navigate to the parent folder of your future project.

Now type `pwd`, which prints the absolute path to your present working directory.
**There must not be any spaces or special characters in the path** (for instance ä, ü,
é, Chinese or Cyrillic characters).

If you have any spaces or special characters on your path, change to a folder that does
not have these special characters (e.g., on Windows, create a directory `C:\projects`.
Do **not** rename your home directory).

Type `git status` , this should yield the output:

```console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

### Installing the template

To install the template repository, first go to the
[econ-project-templates](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates)
repo.

Now follow the official
[instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
on how to create a new repository from a template repository.
