# Templates for Reproducible Research: Documentation

(introduction)=

## Introduction

An empirical or computational research project only becomes a useful building block for
science and policy when all steps can be easily repeated and modified by others.

Hence, some actions should be absent as much as possible. This includes copying and
pasting, pointing and clicking with a mouse, or other forms of interactive input, which
are not stored as part of the project.

The idea behind these templates is that the researcher specifies a set of tasks, which
are executed in the correct order as required. The only input for (re-)producing results
will be the action setting this pipeline to run.

This code base aims to provide two stepping stones to assist you in achieving this goal:

1. A sensible directory structure. This will save you a bunch of thinking about this
   structure time and again, which typically happens when incrementally building up a
   new project. Put differently, instead of starting from scratch, you modify an example
   for your needs.
1. Pre-configured useful tools such as [pre-commit hooks](#pre_commit_hooks), a
   [conda environment](#environments), and
   [pytask](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). These tools help you to
   maintain a clean code base and to automate the workflow of your project.
1. A pre-configured instance of [pytask](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
   which facilitates the reproducibility of your research findings from the beginning to
   the end by letting the computer handle the project's workflow.

The first should lure you in quickly. The second should convince you to stick to the
tools in the long run â€“ unless you have fought with large research projects before, at
this point you may think that all of this is overkill and far more difficult than
necessary. It is not. _\[although I am always_
[happy to hear](https://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/) _about easier alternatives\]_

The templates support a variety of programming languages already. They can be easily
extended to cover others. Everything is tied together by
[pytask](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is written in
[Python](https://www.python.org/). You do not need to know a lot of Python to use these
tools, though.

## Navigating this Documentation

When starting freshly, go to the next section for finding out how to prepare your
machine and how to get started with the template. The {ref}`background` section explains
many of the design choices; feel free to skip if you worked with the templates before.
{ref}`guides_explanations` provides some tips and tricks for usage, depending on whether
you want to start a new project from scratch or port existing code into the structure
suggested in this project. The page also points you to some useful features of helper
programmes that come with the templates. The documentation follows the Python version of
the running example; see {ref}`programming_languages` for additional options.
