## Directory Structure

### The big picture

The following graph shows the contents of template_project root directory after
executing `pytask`

```{figure} ../figures/generated/root_bld_src.png
---
width: 45em

```

Files and directories in yellow are constructed by pytask; those with a bluish
background are added directly by the researcher. You immediately see the **separation of
inputs** and outputs (one of our guiding principles) at work:

- All source code is in the src directory
- All outputs are constructed in the bld directory

```{note} The paper and presentation are copied to the root so they can be opened easily

```

The contents of both the root/bld and the root/src directories directly follow the steps
of the analysis from the workflow section.

The idea is that everything that needs to be run during the, say, **analysis** step, is
specified in root/src/analysis and all its output is placed in root/bld/analysis.

Some differences:

- Because they are accessed frequently, figures and the like get extra directories in
  root/bld

- The directory root/src contains many more subdirectories and files:

### Documents directory structure

The `documents/` directory contains the source files for papers and presentations:

- **`paper.md`**: The main paper written in [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/), which
  is compiled to PDF using
  [Jupyter Book 2.0](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/get-started/init/)
- **`presentation.md`**: The presentation written in [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) Markdown
  format
- **`myst.yml`**: Configuration file for Jupyter Book 2.0, defining project metadata,
  bibliography, and PDF export settings
- **`refs.bib`**: Bibliography file in BibTeX format
- **`public/`**: Directory containing figure files (PNG format) that are generated by
  tasks in `src/template_project/final/task_final_template.py`. Figures are placed here
  so they can be referenced in both the paper and presentation.
- **`tables/`**: Directory containing table files (Markdown format) that are generated
  by tasks in `src/template_project/final/task_final_template.py`. Tables are written in
  Markdown format for inclusion in MyST documents.

The tasks in `src/template_project/final/task_final_template.py` generate:

- Figures in `documents/public/` (e.g., `smoking_by_marital_status.png`)
- Tables in `documents/tables/` (e.g., `estimation_results.md`)

These generated files are then included in the paper and presentation using MyST
Markdown directives (e.g., `{figure}` and `{include}`).

### Zooming in

Lets go one step deeper and consider the root/src directory in more detail:

```{figure} ../figures/generated/src.png

It is imperative that you do all the task handling inside the `task_xxx.py`-scripts,
using the [pathlib](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/) library. This ensures that
your project can be used on different machines and it minimises the potential for
cross-platform errors.

For running Python source code from pytask, simply include `depends_on` and `produces`
as inputs to your function.

For running scripts in other languages, pass all required files (inputs, log files,
outputs) as arguments to the `@pytask.mark.[x]`-decorator. You can then read them in.
Check the sections on different programming languages for examples.
